Map Generation Language

A plain text language which allows users to create graphics for maps. Users can create points, lines and polygons by writing a plain text language. The plain text language will also be able to control the order of layers. At the same time, users can use the language to adjust the position of each symbol. 

This language is designed for quick and easy mapping. Various points, lines, and polygons can be drawn. These different symbols can represent different buildings and roads. This language can also specify the location of objects, the direction of roads and the shape and size of buildings. When different objects overlap, users can specify which layer is above and which one is below.
This language can be used as the ways below:

1. Tell the size of the map background
2. Modify the shape of the figure. This language contains types. The user defines a symbol as point, line or other. Then when the language is run, the corresponding graphics will be generated.
3. Specify the positional relationship between each symbol, for example, the point is in the southwest direction of the rectangle.
4. Give symbols a specific color or shape to distinguish different buildings and locations.
5. Plan the length, direction, and connection of the road.
6. Adjust the priority display order of buildings and adjust the layer by writing the plain text language.
